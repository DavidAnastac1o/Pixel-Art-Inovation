# Pixel-Art-Inovation
Pixel art inovation is a program inspired on [aarthificial unity Pixel Art Inovation](https://youtu.be/HsOKwUwL1bE). What it does is automate your work when you want to change the skin of a sprite and multiple sprites with a little bit of less work. Obviously, once you make the "UV map" of the sprite, future times you use the program will be much easier.

This is my first submission on github, and I am pretty new at coding, so please don't judge my code too harshly, but I am accepting recommendations and, obviously, critics in order to make my code better.
